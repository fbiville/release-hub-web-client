# ReleaseHub

ReleaseHub is (mostly) made of 1 page halping to visualize each of your project trees and the progress made on every of its leaves.

It tracks the releases and changes so you can easily see what needs to be released from what's not.

## Credo

ReleaseHub is designed to be technology-agnostic at its core and extensible through a simple yet solid plug-in ecosystem, thus aiming at supporting major actors.

## Short-term targets

### Build plug-ins

 - Maven 3
 - SBT
 - Gradle

### VCS

 - Git
 - Mercurial

### Issue managers

 - JIRA
 - Github issue API
 - Bitbucket issue AP
